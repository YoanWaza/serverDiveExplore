  "projectDescription": "Our project, DiveExplore, is a social media platform designed for divers worldwide. It enables divers to discover dive spots, share new locations they've found, and interact by commenting and liking each other's posts. A key feature is facilitating connections between divers: if a diver is exploring alone and interested in a specific spot, they can schedule themselves for a dive on a specific day and time. This allows another diver to join them, as diving alone is not permitted in many places. This feature enhances safety and community among divers."
